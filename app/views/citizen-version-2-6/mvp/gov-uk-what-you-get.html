<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>you get Carer’s Allowance</li>
<li>you have claimed Carer's Allowance but are not being paid because you already get another benefit paying a higher amount</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">If you have a partner, you can both get this extra amount if you have claimed or are getting Carer's Allowance.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you are responsible for children or young people</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you are the main carer for children or young people that live with you, you could get an additional payment.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">A child is anyone under 16 years old. A young person is between 16 and 19 and must be in non-advanced education. For example, studying for GSCEs or A levels.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">You will get an extra payment of £54.32 a week for each child or young person. This is increased to £64.82 a week for the first child if they were born before 6 April 2017.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You cannot get this additional payment through Pension Credit if you get Tax Credits.</p>

    <li>ground rent</li>
    <li>some service charges</li>
    <li>charges for tents and site rents</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">The amount you will get depends on your housing costs.</p>


  <p class="govuk-body">If you get Pension Credit, you can also apply for:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Council Tax Reduction</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit if you rent the property you live in, or support with mortgage interest if you own it</li>

</ul>





  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have savings</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">If you reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016, you could also get an extra amount if you have made some provision for retirement, such as savings or a second pension.
